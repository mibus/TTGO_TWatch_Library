**English | [‰∏≠Êñá](docs/details_cn.md)**


The code bin will demonstrate the basic functionality of T-Watch, including all on-board chips from T-Watch, using the **lvgl 6.1.2** as the display graphics framework.

<h2 align = "left">‚≠ê News </h2>

1. Currently there are multiple versions of T-Watch, if you use **T-Watch-2020** version T-Watch, please define the **LILYGO_TWATCH_2020_V1** macro above the sketch `#include <TTGO.h>` to preset the program Run in `T-Watch-2020 version hardware`.
2. Some sample programs cannot be run on special versions of hardware, such as the `UserButton` sample program, which cannot be run in the **T-Watch-2020** version, because this version of the hardware does not have physical buttons

<h2 align = "left">üöÄ Characteristics</h2>

1. The library already contains all the hardware drivers for `T-Watch`
2. Using **TFT_eSPI** as the display driver, you can directly call **TFT_eSPI** through the construction object.
3. Using **lvgl 6.1.2** as the display graphics framework, the driver method has been implemented, you only need to call lvgl api according to your own needs.
4. For the use of lvgl please refer to **[lvgl docs](https://docs.littlevgl.com/en/html/index.html)**


<h2 align = "left">üî∑ Install</h2>

- Download a zipfile from github using the "Download ZIP" button and install it using the IDE ("Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library...", OR:
- Clone this git repository into your sketchbook/libraries folder. For more info, see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries


<h2 align = "left">üî∑ Note</h2>

- If you don't have the `TTGO T-Watch` option in your board manager, please update the esp32 board as follows:
  - Using Arduino IDE Boards Manager (preferred)
    + [Instructions for Boards Manager](docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)
  - Using Arduino IDE with the development repository
    + [Instructions for Windows](docs/arduino-ide/windows.md)
    + [Instructions for Mac](docs/arduino-ide/mac.md)
    + [Instructions for Debian/Ubuntu Linux](docs/arduino-ide/debian_ubuntu.md)
    + [Instructions for Fedora](docs/arduino-ide/fedora.md)
    + [Instructions for openSUSE](docs/arduino-ide/opensuse.md)

<h2 align = "left">üî∂ How to find the sample program</h2>

- In the Arduino board select `TTGO T-Watch`
- In the Arduino File -> Examples -> TTGO T-Watch

 <h2 align = "left">üî∂ Precautions</h2>

- Since Twatch uses a special IO as the SD interface, please remove the SD card when downloading the program.
